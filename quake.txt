* OBJECTIVES
- posix
- cubemaps (skybox)
- textures support
- lighting
- camera (zooming)
- interface and text objects
- physics (movement acceleration and deceleration according to current)
- models (eg size of the Sun = 1.0f, Earth size = 0.004) (orbits) (moons)
- sound
- data (descriptions, positions etc)
- eggs

INSTANCE:
- MESH (shape?, material)
- TRANSFORM (pos, rot, scale)
- 


RENDERER:
deferred rendering (two passes)
    draw object data (positions, normals, colors) into buffers
    apply lightning in a second pass
